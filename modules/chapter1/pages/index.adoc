= Product Enablement: Event-Driven Ansible Troubleshooting Lab

Welcome to the *Troubleshooting Event-Driven Ansible in Ansible Automation Platform* lab. In this session, we will work with Ansible Automation Platform 2.5, GitLab, and a Zabbix Server. 

There are sections 1 through 5 containing issues that need to be identified and resolved. There are multiple issues that you will be learning about including where Zabbix will monitor `node1`, and we will simulate an alert by stopping the Apache server. This alert will be sent to Event-Driven Ansible (Automation Decisions), which will use the Ansible `job template` to resolve the detected issues without any human intervention. Several configuration changes will be required in the environment to achieve this outcome.

== Lab Access

Login from your system using 2 new Terminal and access the *bastion* node as the `Username` and `Password` mentioned on the RHDP platform login page.  

NOTE: The `ec2-user` is the primary user account provisioned on controller, `node1`, and `server`. From the bastion host, the `lab-user` connects to all hosts by utilizing the ssh key of the ec2-user.

All the information related to the login details is mentioned on the RHDP LAB Deployment web page.

== Access other instances from Bastion

* Passwordless authentication is already setup so to Log in to the Ansible Automation Platform Controller from the *bastion* host:

[subs=attributes+]
----
[lab-user@bastion ~]$ ssh controller
----

* Log in to *node1* from *bastion*:

[subs=attributes+]
----
[lab-user@bastion ~]$ ssh node1
----

* Log in to the additional *server* from *bastion*:

[subs=attributes+]
----
[lab-user@bastion ~]$ ssh server
----

== Solution

- A step-by-step guided solution is provided at the end of each lab section. 

- Before proceeding with the solution, take a moment to try the challenge on your own. Your effort to troubleshoot independently will help you gain confidence while working on other issues in the future. 

- Once you have made an attempt, you can refer to the guided solutions to verify your approach or explore an alternate solution.
