= Product Enablement: Event-Driven Ansible Troubleshooting Lab
:navtitle: Home

== Introduction

This course is designed to provide hands-on experience with Event-Driven Ansible within Ansible Automation Platform 2.5. Participants will engage with a critical set of tools, including GitLab for version control and a Zabbix Server for comprehensive monitoring.

The primary objective is to identify and resolve pre-configured issues within Labs 1 through 5. To simulate a practical scenario, node1 will be monitored by Zabbix. An alert will be triggered by intentionally stopping the Apache service. This alert will then be transmitted to Event-Driven Ansible (Automation Decisions), which will subsequently utilize Ansible to remediate the detected issues. Successful completion will necessitate several key configuration adjustments within the environment.

Duration 90 minutes 

== Objectives 

Upon completion of this lab, you will be able to:

- Troubleshoot rulebooks effectively using CURL to diagnose issues within Event-Driven Ansible.
- Utilize CURL with extra_vars to test and debug rulebook behavior with dynamic inputs.
- Configure Event-Driven Ansible to successfully pass extra_vars to Ansible Automation Platform.
- Integrate Event-Driven Ansible and Ansible Automation Platform to automatically remediate issues identified by Zabbix.
